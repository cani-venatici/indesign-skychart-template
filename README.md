# InDesign sky chart template
A basic Adobe InDesign 2020 template that can be used to make custom sky charts. Made for the r/telescopes subreddit [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/telescopes/wiki/index).

Wiki post - [What can I see with my telescope](https://www.reddit.com/r/telescopes/wiki/what-can-i-see-with-my-telescope)

Built upon master pages. To use the template one only needs knowing how to apply master pages, unlock master objects in the page, relink their own sky charts pictures, edit text and export a pdf for printing.
